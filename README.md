# Spells
The following program is a simple grammar and spelling game called Spells. It starts off with giving 
the player a sentence with multiple misspelt words. The user has to identify which of these words are
missspelt, and then find the correct replacement from the options given for each misspelt word. 
The answer should make grammatical sense.

The game is still in development, so it still has trouble recognizing plurals.
