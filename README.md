# Spells
The following program is a simple grammar and spelling game called Spells. It starts off with giving 
the player a sentence with multiple misspelt words. The user has to identify which of these words are
missspelt, and then find the correct replacement from the options given for each misspelt word. 
The answer should make grammatical sense. Only ints are taken as valid input.

A level can be chosen by changing the file name when intializing the program.
Anyone can make their own levels simply by creating a txt file, in which the first line is the
misspelt sentence, and two new lines after is the solution to the sentence.

The game is still in development, so it still has trouble recognizing plurals.
